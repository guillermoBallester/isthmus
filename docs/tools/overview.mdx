---

Isthmus exposes three MCP tools that AI models call to explore and query your PostgreSQL database. You don't call these tools directly — your AI client (Claude, Cursor, etc.) invokes them automatically based on your questions.

## Recommended discovery workflow

When an AI model connects to your database for the first time, the most effective sequence is:

```
1. discover          → What schemas and tables exist? (sizes, row counts, columns)
2. describe_table    → Full table analysis: columns, types, keys, stats, sample rows, index usage
3. query             → Execute a read-only SQL query (with optional EXPLAIN plan)
```

Most AI models follow this pattern naturally — they start broad with `discover`, narrow down to specific tables with `describe_table`, then write and execute SQL with `query`.

## Tool summary

| Tool | Purpose | Parameters |
|---|---|---|
| [`discover`](/tools/discover) | Full database landscape: schemas with nested tables | *(none)* |
| [`describe_table`](/tools/describe-table) | Complete table analysis: columns, statistics, sample rows, index usage | `table_name` (required), `schema` |
| [`query`](/tools/query) | Execute read-only SQL with optional EXPLAIN plans | `sql` (required), `explain`, `analyze` |

## Safety guardrails

All tools operate within Isthmus's safety model:

- **Read-only transactions** — queries cannot modify data
- **SQL validation** — only `SELECT` and `EXPLAIN` statements are allowed (enforced via PostgreSQL AST parsing)
- **Row limits** — configurable max rows per query (default: 100)
- **Query timeout** — configurable timeout (default: 10s)
- **Schema filtering** — only expose the schemas you choose

See [Security](/security) for the full safety model.
