description: "Isthmus's safety model: how it protects your database from unintended AI operations."
---

Isthmus is designed to be safe to point at production databases. Multiple independent layers ensure the AI can only read data, and only the data you allow.

## Local-first architecture

Isthmus runs entirely on your machine. By default, it communicates with your AI client over stdio (standard input/output) — no network ports are opened, no data leaves your machine, and no cloud service is involved.

When using the [HTTP transport](/features/http-transport), Isthmus opens a network port. Bind to `127.0.0.1` to restrict access to your machine, or use a reverse proxy for TLS and authentication if remote access is needed.

## Defense in depth

### 1. SQL AST validation

Every query is parsed using PostgreSQL's actual parser (`pg_query`) and validated at the AST level. Only `SELECT` and `EXPLAIN` statements are allowed. This is not regex matching — it uses the same parser that PostgreSQL itself runs.

See [SQL Validation](/features/sql-validation) for details.

### 2. Read-only transactions

All queries execute inside read-only transactions (`SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY`). Even if a write query somehow passed AST validation, PostgreSQL would reject it.

### 3. Row limits

Results are capped at `MAX_ROWS` (default: 100). This prevents accidental data dumps from `SELECT *` on large tables.

### 4. Query timeout

Queries are cancelled after `QUERY_TIMEOUT` (default: 10s). This prevents runaway queries from consuming database resources.

### 5. Schema filtering

The `SCHEMAS` environment variable restricts which schemas the AI can discover. Only listed schemas appear in `list_schemas`, `list_tables`, and `describe_table` results.

See [Schema Filtering](/features/schema-filtering) for details.

### 6. Column masking

The policy file supports per-column masking rules (`redact`, `hash`, `partial`, `null`) that protect PII in both `query` results and `profile_table` sample rows. Masking is enforced server-side — the AI cannot bypass it regardless of what SQL it generates.

See [Column Masking](/features/column-masking) for details.

### 7. Policy engine

The policy file enriches responses with business context but also acts as a documentation layer — operators can describe exactly what data means, reducing the chance of AI misinterpretation.

See [Policy Engine](/features/policy-engine) for details.

### 8. Explain-only mode

The `--explain-only` flag forces all `query` calls to return `EXPLAIN` plans instead of actual data. Useful for environments where you want the AI to help with query writing without accessing the data.

### 9. Audit logging

The `--audit-log` flag writes every executed query to an NDJSON file with timestamps, row counts, and execution times. Use this for compliance and monitoring.

See [Audit Logging](/features/audit-logging) for details.

### 10. Observability

OpenTelemetry tracing and metrics (`--otel`) let you monitor query latency, error rates, and tool usage in production. Traces include the full SQL statement, row counts, and error details.

See [OpenTelemetry](/features/opentelemetry) for details.

## Recommended Postgres role

For production use, create a dedicated read-only database role:

```sql
-- Create a read-only role
CREATE ROLE isthmus_reader LOGIN PASSWORD 'strong-random-password';

-- Grant connect
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO isthmus_reader;

-- Grant usage on specific schemas
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO isthmus_reader;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA analytics TO isthmus_reader;

-- Grant select on all tables in those schemas
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO isthmus_reader;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA analytics TO isthmus_reader;

-- Ensure future tables are also readable
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public
  GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO isthmus_reader;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA analytics
  GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO isthmus_reader;
```

Then use this role in your connection string:

```
postgres://isthmus_reader:strong-random-password@localhost:5432/mydb
```

## Security checklist

- [ ] Use a dedicated read-only Postgres role
- [ ] Set `SCHEMAS` to limit schema discovery
- [ ] Set `MAX_ROWS` to a reasonable limit for your use case
- [ ] Set `QUERY_TIMEOUT` appropriate for your database
- [ ] Mask PII columns (`email`, `ssn`, `phone`, etc.) in your [policy YAML](/features/column-masking)
- [ ] Enable `--audit-log` in production
- [ ] Consider `--explain-only` if the AI should not access actual data
- [ ] Review the audit log periodically
- [ ] If using HTTP transport, bind to `127.0.0.1` or use a reverse proxy with TLS
- [ ] Consider `--otel` for production monitoring of query performance and error rates
